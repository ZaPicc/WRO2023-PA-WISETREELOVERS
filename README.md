Engineering materials
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction

Robots are the revolution of this era, we are going to use them for our daily tasks, actually we have already started using them in our daily live, in the World Robot Olympiad there are challenges that will help the society.This year in the category Future Engineers we are evolving automatic cars to recognize objects and avoid them. That's why our robot "Wise mystical robot" is qualified to achieve this objectives, win and represent our country Panama. 

We actually started this project a year ago, unfortunaly, due to time issues, we couldn't achieve that the robot could do everything it should do and there were many problems with the programming, the main problems arose where in the physical part since many of the cables were not the right size and they broke easily. That's why this year we provide fix this problems and come back with more potential and motivation, fixing all the problems that surge last year, we change our algorithm and came back more motivated to do the things well. 

## April 

This month is when we regroup because the official robotics club of our school started, the teacher and the school was so good with us that provided some materials for our robots and supported us and we started planning our meetings to progress with the olympiad
