This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction

Robots are the revolution of this era, we are going to use them for our daily tasks, actually we have already started using them in our daily live, in the World Robot Olympiad there are challenges that will help the society.This year in the category Future Engineers we are evolving automatic cars to recognize objects and avoid them. That's why our robot "Wise mystical robot" is qualified to achieve this objectives, win and represent our country Panama. 

We actually started this project a year ago, unfortunaly, due to time issues, we couldn't achieve that the robot could do everything it should do and there were many problems with the programming, the main problems arose where in the physical part since many of the cables were not the right size and they broke easily. That's why this year we provide fix this problems and come back with more potential and motivation, fixing all the problems that surge last year, we change our algorithm and came back more motivated to do the things well. 

## April 

This month is when we regroup because the official robotics club of our school started, the teacher and the school was so good with us that provided some materials for our robots and supported us and we started planning our meetings to progress with the olympiad. In this month we got a kind of prototype for the robot and started trying to get it move. We show to the teacher the robot and she liked it, so we continue with it.

Was in this month when we decided to use ROS2 as a simulator for the robot to have everthing more tracked and to avoid problems with this one, because for experience of the past year this was the best option to test the behavior of the robot.

## May

In this month we started creating the official robot becacuse finaly the principal sensor that is the LIDAR had arrived. We do our first meet where we put on work the LiDAR and it succesfully connect and was working so that was a progress, we also get it to move. We decided to use ROS2 to have a better track of the movement of the robot because basically ROS2 is a simulator especially for robos and projects like this so this was the next step.

ROS2 needed Linux so we get down to work. We got a virtual computer to use linux and installed everthing we needed.

## June and July

This months were to focus on the programming part, that is the most complicated because he had a lot of issues and complications with ROS. Also we got some help that gave us recomendations with the problems and better solutions.



### Now, after talking of the story, basically the robot works this way:

The robot have one motor, the motor boost the back wheels with the help of a motor controller (specificaly L298N) in the front we have a SERVO of 90Â° as directional axis. It has a camera on the front that helps with the color detection, and in the top it has a lidar sensor that basically helps to measure distances. For the programming, we have an arduino and an rock pi 4b, the programming is basically made with ROS2 in python.
